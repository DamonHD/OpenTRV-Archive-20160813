; TRV (and boiler-node) body including control loop for DHD201203 level-0 spec on V0.09 PCB1 hardware.

; A #picaxe and #define CONFIG_... should have been defined textually above this in the .bas file,
; and the I/O pin definitions and any preliminary 'safe' initialisation also.

; See end for TODO and RECENT CHANGES.

#no_end ; Main loop is non-terminating, so save a few bytes!



;-----------------------------------------
; UI DESCRIPTION
; Button causes cycling through 'off'/'frost' target of 5C, 'warm' target of ~18C,
; and an optional 'bake' mode that raises the target temperature to up to ~24C
; for up to ~30 minutes or until the target is hit then reverts to 'warm' automatically.
; (Button may have to be held down for up to a few seconds to get the unit's attention.)
; Acknowledgement is medium/long/double flash in new mode
; (medium is frost, long is 'warm', long+medium is 'bake').

; Without the button pressed,
; the unit generates one to three short flashes on a two-second cycle if in heat mode.
; A first flash indicates "warm mode".  (This first flash will be lengthened if a schedule is set.) 
; A second flash if present indicates "calling for heat".
; A third flash if present indicates "bake mode" (which is automatically cancelled after a short time, or if the high target is hit).

; This may optionally support an interactive CLI over the serial connection,
; with reprogramming initiation permitted (instead of CLI) while the UI button is held down.

; If target is not being met then aim to turn TRV on/up and call for heat from the boiler too,
; else if target is being met then turn TRV off/down and stop calling for heat from the boiler.
; Has a small amount of hysteresis to reduce short-cycling of the boiler.
; Does some proportional TRV control as target temperature is neared to reduce overshoot.

; This can use a simple setback (drops the 'warm' target a little to save energy)
; eg using an LDR, ie reasonable ambient light, as a proxy for occupancy.

; TODO
; DHD20130313: allow simple built-in schedule and maybe reset RTC to noon if button is held down at power-up (or allow stub program to set RTC then reload this, at a pinch).
; DHD20130312: create simple command-line interface (will "disconnect" except at boot and while button held down).
; DHD20130301: implement weekly 'descale' operation (when room not dark!).
; DHD20130228: create 'learn' function that (if in warm mode) repeats 'warm' every 24h for 1h from push of 'learn' button, else if in frost mode cancels; manual operation as usual remains possible.  Maybe 2 buttons for 2 independent heat programmes.
; DHD20130227: allow wired-OR input on boiler node to call for heat (from OUT_HEATCALL on some/all TRV nodes as required, eg opto-isolated).
; DHD20130223: use the calibadc command periodically to estimate supply voltage, eg to limit clock speed and/or warn of low batteries and/or shutdown gracefully.


; RECENT CHANGES
; DHD20130408: trimming excess code to squeeze in learn/status support.
; DHD20130408: allowing generation of status summary once per minute.
; DHD20130405: creating simple singleton (1-on, 1-off) schedule triggered in first second of specified HH:MM, also to work with simple 'learn' mode.
; DHD20130405: made boost mode optional, to conserve code space.
; DHD20130331: knocked down 'warm' target 1C after seeing 16WW gas consumption figures for last 3M!
; DHD20130330: delay sending extra calls for heat for boiler node's benefit unless valve has already been sent command to open (to avoid boiler running with TRV closed).
; DHD20130329: allowing boiler to be turned off faster (by boiler node) when no call for heat detected, so as to spend less time running with all TRVs closed.
; DHD20130321: testing use of 1Hz RTC output to reduce power consumption in idle portion of loop; down to ~350uA.
; DHD20130318: tweaked to save energy in coda of quiet loops, while reducing timing jitter that can cause FHT8V problems.
; DHD20130311: implementing slowOpDone to help easily avoid attempting to do multiple slow things in one cycle.
; DHD20130228: split out per-node config into separate prepended header files.
; DHD20130227: integrating RX code to listen to remote TRVs' calls for heat if in BOILER_HUB mode (not exclusive with having own local TRV).
; DHD20130227: introduced 'bake' mode that sets a high target temperature for a short while.
; DHD20130226: scheduling extra wireless TX at randomised offset to reduce risk of boiler node getting into anti-sync with TRV nodes.
; DHD20130226: temporary ugly hack (RFM22_SYNC_ONLY_BCFH): omitting RFM22-friendly aaaaaaaa preamble when not calling for heat so boiler node need only detect sync or time out.
; DHD20130225: minimum and maximum TRV slew rates now implements to minimise overshoot and noise, and to conserve batteries and heating.
; DHD20130224: split FHT8V message encoding from TX, and does the former only on a change.
; DHD20130225: now only shows 'heat call' flash if user has selected 'warm' mode; will request silently if necessary for frost protection.
; DHD20130225: only turning TRV on relatively slowly ("slow start") but off quickly to conserve and limit noise and overshoot.
; DHD20130225: only recomputing targets and outputs about once per minute to allow time-based control.
; DHD20130223: first attempt to reduce spurious TRV hunting/noise on small temperature changes/noise; no time element yet.
; DHD20130222: enabled RTC to improve timing (NB: setup check spotted missing CE connection on stripboard!).
; DHD20130221: added 0xaaaaaaaa RFM22B-friendly pre-preamble at Mike Stirling's suggestion.
; DHD20130218: freed up B.1 and B.4 to allow use of i2c peripherals, relocating LED_HEATCALL from B.1 to B.7. (r417)
; DHD20130218: currently assumes presence of DS18B20 1-wire temp sensor, but only good down to 3V so may need to be able to use alternative.
; DHD20130212: for now transmits every second to be heard by FHT8V TRV, wasting energy, etc!

; ****** FHT8V-simple.inc.bas ****** in module library

; RECENT CHANGES
; DHD20130324: No longer try to send actual TRVPercentOpen on final sync (cmd 0) in FHT8VPollSyncAndTX: anything other than zero seems to lock up FHT8V-3 units.
; DHD20130225: created separate FHT8VQueueCmdViaRFM22Bptr routine to allow generation to be separated from TX.
; DHD20130224: added 0xff postamble to transmitted frame to be easier to capture by RFM22/PICAXE.
; DHD20130224: creating FHT8VCreate200usBitStreamBptr with bptr base to allow possibility of cacheing, etc.
; DHD20130223: using 0xaacccccc RX sync word (end of RFM22 pre-preamble and start of FHT preamble) for robustness.
; DHD20130223: turned down transmission power: may have to make setting conditional on whether RFM23 is being used instead.

; ****** LDROccupancyDetection.inc.bas ****** in module library
; Simple occupancy detection using ambient light levels.
; Appendable PICAXE basic fragment.

; RECENT CHANGES
; DHD20130301: Added optional LDR_EXTRA_SENSITIVE for LDR not exposed to direct light to boost sensitivity.
; DHD20130225: Changed global this sets to "isRoomLit" and also uses it to provide hysteresis.
; DHD20130221: Bumped threshold up a little to 33 (~13%) based on observations.


; Dependencies:
; INPUT_LDR ADC input pin symbol must be defined with LDR to +V and pull-down to 0V (so more light gives higher value).
; #ifdef LDR_EXTRA_SENSITIVE (optional) ; Define this if LDR not exposed to much light, eg behind a grille.
; isRoomLit bit symbol must be defined; will be set to 1 if room is light enough for occupancy/activity, 0 otherwise.
; tempB0 temporary byte symbol must be defined; will be used/overwritten.
; #ifdef OMIT_MODULE_LDROCCUPANCYDETECTION suppresses inclusion of module code.

; Using techsupplies.co.uk SEN002 (like GL5528 1M+ dark, ~10k @ 10 Lux) with fixed pull-down resistor.
; Works OK with 10k pull-down and http://www.techsupplies.co.uk/SEN002 LDR to +V (5V) at threshold of 25 (~10% max).

; Basic support for RFM22B (or RFM23B) radio transceivers in SPI mode (si443x chipset), and no use of interrupts.

; Many thanks to Mike Stirling http://mikestirling.co.uk/2012/10/hacking-wireless-radiator-valves-with-gnuradio/

; DHD20130312: Using B0 versions of some SPI routines for performance.
; DHD20130309: only reading status reg 1 (#3) in FIFO TX, but also only terminating on ipksent (bit 2); may have fixed 32MHz unreliability problem.
; DHD20130224: testing 'gosub chaining' at tail of subroutines to save gosub slots and possible some time/space.
; DHD20130222: using pause and loop limit in RFM22TXFIFO to avoid lockup in that routine (bashing on SPI too hard) and save some juice?
; DHD20130222: using RFM22ModeStandbyAndClearState at end of init and TXFIFO routines in hope of reducing power consumption (turning interrupts off).

DHD20130223: Interesting thought on the RFM22 resetting itself. How would you (quickly) check in this instance if such a reset had happened so the config could be re-applied?

srnet:

There is a POR flag bit that should be set, but I found it more reliable to check if the 3 main frequency setting registers have changed away from their configured settings.

Which also serves another purpose, you can check that you are actually transmitting on the frequency you should be.

There are also circumstances where if there is enough RF power fed back into the circuit, the Si4432 (the microcontroller on the RFM22) has its brains scrambled completely, the registers go haywire. The only recovery is a shutdown of the device, so dont just ground the SDN pin, control it with a PICAXE pin so you can force a RFM22 reset.
